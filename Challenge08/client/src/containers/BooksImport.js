        "description": "JavaScript has become the most popular programming language in the world. It has attained that position by being easy to use and powerful in its capabilities. It wasn't always that way but today it can be used to build virtually any application you desire. With the addition of HTML5 and CSS3, it allows for wonderfully animated and powerful web sites and applications without having to use other technologies such as Adobe Flash. JavaScript has also become much more standardized across the multiple browsers in use today. With the recent proliferation of libraries and frameworks that many developers use, the focus has shifted towards these new tools, but they still rely on native JavaScript. And these libraries and frameworks can greatly increase the size of your code as well as slowing down performance. This book covers best practices for coding in straight JavaScript as well as pointing out many areas for optimization. The goal is to help programmers produce smaller and faster JavaScript applications. Even programmers using frameworks and libraries can benefit from understanding the performance trade-offs they make when using those tools.",

        "description": "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.",

This book is also for web/front-end developers who would like webapps to be developed faster and more easily using the ReactJS framework. Basic knowledge of JavaScript is expected. What You Will Learn Learn functional reactive programming with JavaScript for non-mathematicians Experience Facebook's primary front-end framework, ReactJS Using the tools Facebook uses to build a better site in less time Create and implement Node.js Delve into the development of webapps using ReactJS Implementation of FRP ReactJS with live examples In Detail Reactive programming is carried out using the building blocks of functional programming. JavaScript libraries such as ReactJS are used for front-end web development that is both competent and powerful. ReactJS is intensively being used to develop webapps for Facebook. This title is among the first of those addressing how everyday programmers can take advantage of (functional) reactive programming without having an extremely heavy mathematical background. It starts with the basics a front-end developer can easily connect with, while also covering the basics of functional programming. Then it goes on to explain non-functional reactive programming with the help of a live example. After that it gives a theoretical overview of reactive programming supported by functional programming. Tools to make functional reactive programming easier like Bacon.js, a library like jQuery, are also covered. Finally, it finishes with building one small and one larger front-end project. Style and approach A rounded and multifaceted approach covers reactive JavaScript with Facebook's ReactJS. The author's lively approach makes the book even more engaging. Also, with easy-to-understand examples, readers will learn how to use functional reactive programming with JavaScript.",

Beginning Facebook Game Apps Development gets you started with building your first game apps that run on Facebook. Become your own \"Zynga\" and create your own \"Civilization\" or \"Farmville\" and more. Build rich Web-based apps that you can sell on Facebook's App Store. Because these apps are built on Web standards, you can build and run on many browsers and—more interestingly—more computers, tablets, smartphones and even other devices and appliances that are Web-connected or enabled.",
